- "[...]This book is unique in that it does not give a cookbook of algorithms, rather it helps the reader understand the underlying concepts behind data science, and most importantly how to approach and be sucessful at problem solving." - Chirs Volinsky, Director Statistics Research, AT&T Labs and Winner of the $1 Million Netflix Challenge.
- Data Science for Business is intended for several sorts of readers:
  - Business people who will be working with data scientists, managing data science oriented projects, or investing in data science ventures,
  - Developers who will be implementing data science solutions, and
  - Aspiring data scientists.
- This is not a book about algorithms.
- keep math and statistics to a minimum.
