Preface
---

Book:

- Not algorithm-centered,
- Fundamentals (Foundations),
- data-centered business problems,
- creation and evaluation of data science solutions,
- evaluation of general data science strategies and proposals,
- general principles rather then specific algorithms,
- text and diagrams rather than algorithms steps,
- does not presume high mathematical background

Goals:
- [View business problems from a data perspective](# "Problems and Solutions")
- Understand principles of extracting useful knowledge from data
- Change to a data perspective mindset
- Spot obvious project flaws, unrealistic assumptions and missing pieces
- [Data mining projects requires trying](# "Solutions that did not work at first")
- [Discover pattern that are not obvious](# "Hurricane Example")
- [obs](# "make a dynamic for each at the end")

Audience:

- Business People
- Managers
- Developers
- Aspiring to Data Scientist

Concepts:

1. How data science fits in the organization
   1. Competitive landscape
   2. Attract and Structure Data Science teams
   3. How data science leads to competitive advantage
   4. Doing well with data science projects
1. Thinking data analytically
   1. Identify appropriate data
   1. Consider appropriate methods
   1. Data mining process
   1. Data mining tasks 
1. Extracting Knowledge from data
   1. Data science tasks
   2. Data science algorithms

Universities:

- Cambridge University
- Elon University
- Federal University of ParanÃ¡, Brazil
- Harvard
- The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
- [Johns Hopkins University](# "Cloudera")
- [...](http://data-science-for-biz.com/adopters.html)
  
Context:

- Past 50 years
- Extensive investments in infrastructure
- Improve the ability to collect data
  - operation
  - manufacturing
  - marketing
  - customer behavior
  - [...](# "search for more examples")
- Information is now widely available
- Increases interest in extract knowledge from data
- Emergency of data science

Why:

- Companies are focused on exploiting data for competitive advance
- In the past statisticians were hired to explore datasets manually
- [Volume and variety](# "Big Data") outstripped the capacity of manual analysis
- [Computers have become more powerful](# "Distributed Computing")
- [Network has become ubiquitous](# "Cloud")
- [New algorithms](# "Algorithms Timeline") were developed to enable broader and deeper analysis
- Emergency of data mining techniques

Applications:

- Targeted Marketing
- Online Advertising
- Recommendations for cross-selling
- [...](# "Search for more")

### Data mining

- Customer Relationship
  - analyze customer behavior
  - manage attrition
  - maximize customer value
  - Customer Churn
  - [Customer Retention*](# "Still major use of data mining?")
- Finance
  - Credit Scoring
  - Trading
  - Fraud Detection
  - Workforce Management
- Retail
  - Marketing
  - Supply-chain management
  - Amazon, Walmart
- Others
  - Many firms have evolved into data mining companies through data science
- [obs](# "Get big companies examples for each")

### Data Science, Data Engineering, Data-driven Decison Making
